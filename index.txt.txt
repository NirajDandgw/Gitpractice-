tjis is file 1


git add .  ---> means adding all filees in working directory
git add index.html means adding singlr file



git commit -m "commites the file"  --> -m means messaage it requried to pass the message when you commited


git branch -M main goto to the main brach to push the current file in remote reppository
git remote add origin https://github.com/NirajDandgw/Gitpractice-.git    add the orgin where we want to push the files

when we are change only one file and there is no untracked file then we add commiet in single command
git commit -am "changes are added"



when you dont want to write repeat repeat
git push orgin main
then use (git push -u origin main) u for upstream that we are set our origin
then we want to write only (git push) command)

same for above
 git push --set-upstream origin feature
